# 🚀 TradeMotor: Quantitative Strategy Backtester
TradeMotor is a custom-built Python framework designed to backtest trading 
strategies using real-world data. It combines a calculation engine (wrapping the Yahoo Finance API) with a persistent 
SQLite database to track portfolio performance and log transactions.

This project bridges the gap between simple data fetching and actual portfolio tracking, 
allowing you to simulate trades, manage a cash balance, and store your trading history permanently.

## ✨ Key Features
### ⚙️ The Calculation Motor: 

A helpful wrapper around yfinance that fetches price history and facilitates the 
 calculation of basic fundamental metrics (like TTM EPS and PE Ratios).

### 💾 Persistent Database: 
 
Uses SQLite to store a permanent log of all BUY, SELL, DEPOSIT, and WITHDRAW events.

### 💰 Automated Cash Management: 

Automatically deducts cost from your cash balance when you buy and credits cash when 
 you sell.

### 🍰 Fractional Shares: 

Full support for fractional trading (e.g., buying 0.5 shares).

### 📂 Project Structure
